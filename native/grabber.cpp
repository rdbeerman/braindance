/**
 * The webcam output's producer: the colour camera's own picture, encoded off the
 * frame loop.
 *
 * **Why a second encode at all.** Type 2 already carries colour, but it carries the
 * *registered* colour - `Registration::apply`'s resample of the colour camera into
 * the depth camera's viewpoint. That image wears the depth camera's 70.6 degree
 * frustum rather than the colour camera's 84.1, and it is punched through with holes
 * wherever the depth solve returned nothing, because registration has no depth to
 * carry a colour sample on. It is a texture for a point cloud and not a picture of a
 * room, so a webcam has to start from the 1920x1080 frame instead.
 *
 * **Why its own thread.** A 1080p TurboJPEG encode at the same settings measures
 * 5.50ms mean on this machine - 90 real sensor frames over a six-second subscription,
 * no warmup discarded, zero busy drops, q80, TJSAMP_420, FASTDCT. The serial half of
 * the frame loop is 7.1ms against a 33ms budget with `Registration::apply` taking 6.3
 * of it, so encoding here would add the full encode to capture-to-wire latency for an
 * output most runs do not have attached. On its own thread the loop pays the copy
 * below and nothing else.
 *
 * **Why it copies rather than borrows.** The `Frame` handed in belongs to
 * libfreenect2's listener and is released when the next colour frame arrives. At
 * 30fps that is 33ms against a 5.50ms mean encode, so borrowing would be safe almost
 * always - and "almost always" is a data race that surfaces as a torn picture on a
 * dim-light run nobody can reproduce.
 *
 * **Drop-to-latest rather than a queue.** A colour frame arriving while the encoder
 * is busy overwrites the pending one. A queue would grow latency under exactly the
 * condition a live output cannot afford it, and a webcam wants the newest frame
 * rather than every frame.

/**
 * Reads a flag given in metres, or refuses it.
 *
 * `std::strtof` rather than the `std::atof` this used to be, and the end pointer is the
 * whole of the difference: `atof` has no way at all to say "that was not a number". It
 * answers 0.0 for `x`, and - the one that actually destroys footage - it stops at the
 * first character it cannot read and keeps what it had, so `--max-depth 4,5` typed on a
 * keyboard whose decimal separator is a comma clips at 4.0m and the hello reports 4.000
 * with complete confidence. Half a metre of the room is missing from a file that cannot
 * be shot again, the frame rate is a healthy 30.0, and nothing downstream can tell.
 *
 * So the token has to be consumed entirely, and the value has to be one this pair can
 * mean: `nan` and `inf` both parse cleanly through `strtof` and would reach libfreenect2
 * as a clip plane, and zero or a negative distance is a plane at or behind the sensor.
 * What is deliberately *not* refused is a large finite value - the u16 millimetre
 * conversion already floors anything past 65.535m to "no reading", so a wide clip is
 * permissive rather than wrong, and a ceiling invented here would be a number this file
 * had an opinion about with nothing behind it.
 *
 * **Two edges of `strtof` measured rather than assumed**, by compiling this function on
 * its own and running the cases through it. `" 4.5"` is accepted and `"4.5 "` is refused,
 * because `strtof` consumes leading whitespace itself and leaves trailing whitespace for
 * the end pointer to find. The asymmetry is stated rather than smoothed over: trimming
 * would be repairing an argument, and everything else in this block refuses one instead.
 * And `"0x10"` parses as 16 metres, because a hex float is a float - which is not a
 * number anybody types for a distance, so it is recorded here rather than given a rule.
 * Measured: 0.05, 9.0 and 4.5 accepted; `4,5`, `x`, empty, `6m`, `nan`, `inf`, `-inf`,
 * `0`, `-1`, `1e40` and `1e-60` all refused.
