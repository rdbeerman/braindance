// The library: one manifest over a captures directory, the marks that hang off
// each take, the projects and presets beside them, and the reconciliation with a
// capture node that makes "local", "remote" and "both" mean something.
//
// Three properties shape everything in this file.
//
// **Reconciliation is by content hash and never by filename, size or date.** That
// is the payoff for hash-referencing captures in step 2: two machines holding the
// same bytes under different names are holding the same take by definition, and
// two different takes that happen to share a name are two takes. Nothing here
// compares a name to decide identity.
//
// **Nothing is ever deleted automatically.** There is no eviction policy, no LRU
// over footage, no reclaim-when-low. `reclaim` and `delete` are different actions
// rather than one action with two buttons: reclaim removes a copy while a
// hash-verified one survives elsewhere, and this file *verifies* that rather than
// believing a manifest that said `both` a moment ago. Delete removes the last copy
// and is the only irreversible action in the tool.
//
// **Nothing reads a capture whole.** `fs.readFileSync` refuses at 2 GiB and a take
// is routinely larger, so the manifest reads indexes, the download streams, and
// the hash of a downloaded take comes from the same streaming scan step 2 built.

 *
 * It is here rather than in the pages because it was in the pages, twice, twelve lines
 * apart, and they disagreed. A take with a hello and no whole frame was badged "the

 * a take that has none. Measured on the shipped build before this moved, with the
 * `hello-no-frames` fixture `library-check` now plants: nothing had ever reached that
 * shape, because the take with zero frames carried no hello and answered on the
 * recording branch, and the take with a hello had a frame.
 *
 * Zero frames and one frame are different facts and the sentence says which, which is
 * the distinction the gallery's badge already drew and the button did not.
 *
 * **A table rather than three pushes with their sentences inline, because the keys have
 * a second reader.** `web/library.js` keeps its own table of what each key is badged as
 * over a 228px poster, and the two have to cover the same keys or a refusal arrives
 * with no badge. A check comparing the page's table against the refusals that happen to

 * gone stale removes a file whose bytes nobody looked at. A rename undone is a rename
 * back. So this pays the cheap check that catches the case that actually happens - the
 * library moved between the tile being drawn and the button being pressed, which
 * changes size or modification time and therefore fails the sidecar's own staleness
 * test - and does not read four gigabytes off a card to relabel a file.
 *
 * **The take being recorded is refused, and that refusal is load-bearing rather than
 * tidy.** `scanTakes` decides which take is open by comparing paths against
 * `recorder.openPath`, so a take renamed mid-shoot stops matching: `describeTake`
 * drops out of the unscanned branch and starts a full read plus sha256 of a file the
 * recorder is still writing to, on the disk it is writing to, on every `/library/*`
 * request. That is exactly the contention section 11 of `library-check` exists to
 * keep closed, reached by a door the caller cannot see from the rename's own answer -
 * which is why the refusal is asserted here as well as at the route.
 *
 * The three files move in an order chosen for what a failure partway leaves behind.
 * Marks first and the capture second, with the marks put back if the capture will not
 * move, because marks are the one artifact here that cannot be regenerated - they are
 * what somebody pressed in the room. The index last and its failure swallowed, because
 * a `.idx` is a cache of a scan and the next reader rebuilds it; the stale one at the
