 * One frame's payload sampled down by a depth divisor, or the payload itself at a
 * divisor of 1.
 *
 * Decimation is a **network** concession and never a compute one, which is why it
 * lives here rather than in any one consumer: the monitor asks for it because a
 * radio link cannot carry 14.6 MB/s, the editor asks for it when the take is on the
 * other end of that link, the gallery asks for it to skim a take that has not been
 * downloaded, and the live socket asks for it because a full-rate monitor costs the
 * take frames. One mechanism, four callers.
 *
 * **The fourth caller is why this is a function and not a method.** The first three
 * hold a `Capture` - a file on disk with an index over it - and the socket holds a
 * buffer that has not been written yet. Reaching for a `Capture` there was never
 * possible, so the alternative to this was a second copy of the loop on the live
 * path, drifting from this one about what a `÷4` frame is until a monitor and a
 * gallery tile disagreed about the same take.
 *
 * What comes back is still a KNCT frame - same sixteen-byte payload header, same
 * field offsets, same decoder - carrying a `ceil(DEPTH_W/k) x ceil(DEPTH_H/k)` grid
 * sampled nearest-neighbour. **The colour block is copied through untouched**, and
 * that is deliberate rather than an omission: at a divisor of 4 the depth falls from
 * 424KB to 27KB while the JPEG stays at about 52KB, so colour is what a decimated
 * frame mostly is, and a version that dropped it would be a different mechanism
 * wearing this one's measured numbers.
 *
 * **What goes to disk is unaffected, and on the live path that is a property rather
 * than an observation.** The recorder is handed the grabber's own framed bytes
 * before this is ever called, so no divisor any monitor asks for can reach the
 * take - which is the `nearClip` versus `--min-depth` failure by another name, and
 * the one this design cannot afford, since it destroys footage in the situation
 * where nobody is watching for it. `monitor-check` asserts the identity rather than
 * trusting this paragraph.
 *
 * `what` names the frame in a refusal, because the two callers identify frames
 * differently - by index in a take, or as whatever just arrived on the wire.

 * **Percentiles rather than extremes, and the difference is the whole design.** The
 * widest samples a take carries are single texels at the frame corners, at the range
 * limit where this sensor's depth is mostly speckle - on 2026-08-07-take1 the extreme
 * x runs to 5.98m while the 99.5th percentile is 1.91m. Fitting to the extreme would
 * hand back the bound it was trying to replace. A percentile also answers the question
 * a take that goes outdoors halfway through raises: a sustained stretch of further
 * geometry is a real share of the samples and moves p99.5 out, where a doorway at the
 * sensor's limit does not.
 *
 * **The whole take, not a frame.** A fit to frame zero is a box that crops whatever the
 * take does later, which is the one failure this must not have. Cost, measured warm on
 * this machine: a full scan of take1's 738 frames took 0.18s and a stride-8 scan 0.07s,
 * with take2's 1953 frames at 0.26s - and stride 64, twelve frames, already lands within
 * 5cm of the full scan on every face. Stride 8 is therefore comfortable rather than
 * tuned, and the histograms mean the scan never holds its samples: a full pass at every
 * fourth texel is twenty million of them.
 *
 * **The depth pair is not fitted and this returns nothing for it.** Fitting depth to the
 * cloud fits to the back wall, and the sensor sees the back wall: a p1/p98 fit asks for
 * a far plane of 9.06m on take2 and 9.08m on take3 against the 6m they open at, which is
 * wider rather than narrower. What the depth range does here is decide which points the
 * lateral fit is over - a box has no business bounding points the box already discards -
 * which is why it is an argument rather than a constant, and why the cache below keys on
 * it.
