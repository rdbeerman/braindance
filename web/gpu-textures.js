/**
 * Which two sensor frames the GPU is holding, and the one door a new one replaces
 * them through.
 *
 * There are two of each kind rather than one because the vertex stage interpolates
 * between the last two arrivals - that is what makes an 8-15fps stream look fluid on
 * a 120Hz display - so "the current frame" is really a pair with a direction, and the
 * only operation that keeps the pair honest is a swap. Every acquisition path in the
 * program goes through the same swap here rather than writing a texture of its own,
 * because a socket arrival, a pinned run and an indexed pull that each did their own
 * would leave the renderer producing a different image depending on where the bytes
 * came from.
 *
 * **Nothing is allocated while this module evaluates.** The four textures are built by
 * `buildTextures`, which `web/main.js` calls in the order it writes out, because an ES
 * module runs its whole body before its importer's first statement - so anything built
 * up here would make the boot order a property of how the imports happen to be sorted,
 * which an import-sorting reflex or a merge can change without anybody reading a line
 * of it.
 *
 * `buildTextures` hands back the five uniform cells the cloud's shader reads its source
 * frames through, and `web/point-cloud.js` composes those same cells into its material by
 * reference rather than copying their values. That is what lets the door below reach the
 * shader without importing the material it feeds: a uniform is a cell the GPU reads, and
 * a second copy of one is a second answer to which texture is current. The cells go by way
 * of `web/main.js`, which holds what this returns and hands it to `buildPointCloud` - so
 * the wiring is one line of the boot rather than an import each way.

 * A decimated grid back onto the sensor's own, nearest-neighbour, which is exactly

 * `-(col + 0.5 - cx) / fx * z` against intrinsics the sensor reported for a 512x424
 * grid, so where a sample sits in the texture *is* the ray it is claimed to lie on.
 * Writing a smaller grid straight into the larger one is therefore not a coarser
 * picture, it is a different scene. At ÷4 the 13,568 samples land in the first 27 of
 * 424 rows and the live cloud collapses into a band about a metre above the optical
 * axis, while the 203,520 texels the frame cannot reach - 93.8% of the grid - keep
 * the last full-rate frame and stand there frozen where the room used to be. That
 * reads as the depth returns having lost their scale, which is what it was reported
 * as, and it is a monitor silently changing its own geometry: the one thing the
 * design says an instrument must never do.
 *
 * Paying it back in compute rather than on the wire is the right side to pay on. The
 * divisor exists because a radio link cannot carry 14.6 MB/s and never because a
 * machine could not keep up, so expanding here costs the client the GPU it already
 * had spare and leaves the saving where it was asked for.
 *
 * Private to this file, because the only way to reach it is through the depth door
 * below - an acquisition path that expanded a block itself and then handed over the
 * result would be the second expansion site this arrangement exists to prevent.
