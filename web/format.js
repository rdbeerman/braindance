/**
 * The document format's version, in one place because two copies of a constant
 * that must agree is the drift this design keeps refusing.
 *
 * Both sides need it and they need the *same* one. The page stamps it on every
 * project and preset it saves and refuses to open anything else; the server stamps
 * it again as documents are written to disk, so a file that reached the store some
 * other way still carries it. A check that caught the two disagreeing would only be
 * proving they can, which is not the same as there being one number.
 *
 * It lives under `web/` because that is the side with a delivery constraint: the
 * browser can only import what the server serves, and `web/` is served. Node has no
 * such constraint and reaches for it by path.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Version 1 means every screen-space term is expressed against a 1080p
 * reference.** `pointSize` above all: it is pixels at 1080p now and was pixels at
 * the drawing buffer before step 6, so the same number means two different sizes
 * either side of that change, and both built-in presets were rebased by 1080/600 to
 * follow it. There are no documents older than version 1, which is exactly why the
 * field went in when it did - once files exist there is no way to add it
 * retroactively, and a document whose units cannot be recovered is one that renders
 * wrong with nothing to say why.
 *
 * A version rather than an authored buffer height, and the difference is what a
 * loader can *do* with it. An authored height answers one question - what to scale
 * `pointSize` by - and from here on would record 1080 in every file forever, a
 * constant that looks like data. A version answers "can this build faithfully
 * interpret this document", which is the question that recurs: the next thing to
 * move will be a track kind, an easing rule or an audio reference, and none of those
 * is a scale factor. So a file this build does not recognise is refused, naming the
 * version it found, rather than opened on a best guess.
 *
 * **Version 2 adds clip in/out points in program seconds.** They are composition,
 * not look, so they sit in the project and not in a preset. `in` defaults to 0 and
 * `out` defaults to null, meaning the end of the clip. The version is the same
 * "can this build faithfully interpret this document" signal as before.
 *
 * **Version 3 splits the document into look and composition.** Look holds the
 * mode, static params and keyed tracks for look parameters; composition holds the
 * retime curve and the camera track. Deliverables (in/out points, output fps,
 * output size and codec) now live in their own store, not inside the project.
 * Saved projects also carry an undo history (`history.stack` and
 * `history.baseline`) so a reload can restore it.
 *
 * **Version 4 dissolves the mode into five reading weights.** `look.mode` is gone
 * from the project and `mode` is gone from the preset; what replaces both is five
 * ordinary look parameters - `readRgb`, `readDepth`, `readGhost`, `readContour`,
 * `readBlackwall` - which travel with every other value and need no special case.
 *
 * This is the version that most needs to be a refusal rather than a best guess, and
 * for a reason the earlier ones did not have. A version 3 document read by this build
 * would parse: its `values` are all still parameters this registry knows, so
 * `params.apply` would write every one of them without complaint, and the reading
 * would simply be missing - leaving whatever the previous document happened to
 * select. A file that renders as somebody else's shading, silently, is worse than one
 * that fails to open. `tools/convert-presets.mjs` is the way across, and it is a
 * one-shot over files on disk rather than a path inside the program, because a loader
 * that could read both shapes is the second implementation this design keeps refusing.

/**
 * The sentence a document from the wrong version gets, in one place because the two
 * doors were saying different things about the same file - and one of them was false.
 *
 * The refusal used to be two branches: version 3 was told to run the converter, and
 * *everything else* was told that point size was pixels at the drawing buffer before
 * version 1, so its look could not be reconstructed. That is only true of a document
 * from before the version field existed, and the history above says there are none -
 * so a version 1 or 2 project, whose point sizes are already 1080p and perfectly
 * recoverable, was sent looking for a scale factor that is not its problem, and a
 * document from a *later* build was told something about a format that predates it by
 * four versions. A refusal that diagnoses the wrong thing is worse than one that says
 * only "no", because it is followed.
 *
 * Three bands, which is what the shipped conversion actually distinguishes.
 * `convert-presets.mjs` is the only migration this repo has and it starts at 3, so 1
 * and 2 are honestly "known, and there is no path from here" rather than either
 * "convertible" or "unreadable units". Everything else - a later version, a version
 * field that is absent or is not a number - collapses into one sentence because the
 * true statement about all of them is the same: nothing here knows what the document
 * means, and guessing is the failure the version field exists to prevent.

 * The generation of the capture format this build writes and reads, in one place for
 * the same reason the document's version is - except that the artifact it stamps
 * cannot be re-authored.
 *
 * A project can be rebuilt from a look somebody still remembers and an index can be
 * rebuilt from the capture it indexes. The capture is the shoot: whatever the room
 * was doing at that moment exists as those bytes and nowhere else. So the argument
 * `PROJECT_VERSION` makes - a build that cannot faithfully interpret a file refuses
 * it rather than rendering somebody else's meaning silently - is the same argument
 * here with the stakes moved, because a document read wrong can be read again and a
 * take reprojected wrong is a take nobody will ever notice was reprojected wrong.
 *
 * The failure this exists for needs no adversary. Change the depth quantisation, or
 * move `registration.undistortDepth` on the no-colour path, and every take written
 * afterwards is byte-indistinguishable in *structure* from every take written before:
 * same magic, same two message types, same hello keys. One geometry model then runs
 * over two populations and the older half of the archive is quietly wrong, with
 * nothing on screen to attribute it to.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Version 1 is the format as it settled**: u16 millimetre depth on the sensor's own
 * 512x424 grid, colour registered into that grid, and the intrinsics in the hello. It
 * is `1` rather than a larger number because nothing has moved the depth quantisation
 * or the registration path since the format settled - a version field that lies is
 * worse than none, so if a geometry change ever turns out to already be in the
 * archive, this number is wrong and saying so is the only honest repair.
 *
 * **Three bands, and the first is the one that keeps the existing archive readable.**
 *
 * A hello carrying no `format` key at all is honestly generation zero and opens.
 * Every take on disk today is one, the field cannot be added to them retroactively -
 * nothing in this program rewrites a capture, deliberately - and `describeTake`
 * already reads `startedAt` by exactly this presence-sniff for exactly this reason.
 * Presence-sniffing works once, which is what this field is for: it is the last time
 * an absent key has to mean anything.
 *
 * A hello carrying `CAPTURE_FORMAT` opens, because this build wrote it.
 *
 * Anything else is refused - a later number, or a `format` that is not a number at
 * all. Refused rather than unprojected on this build's assumptions, and naming what
 * it found, because a take from a generation this build has never heard of is
 * geometry nobody can check, which is the same case the no-hello refusal covers one
 * band earlier.
 *
 * **Bumping this number is a decision about every earlier one, and the comparison below
 * is deliberately strict so that it cannot be made by default.** `format === CAPTURE_FORMAT`
 * means the day this becomes 2, every generation-1 take is refused unless the same commit
 * says what happens to them - an accept set, or a refusal somebody chose. That is the
 * right way round for the one artifact that cannot be made again: locking the archive out
 * should be something a person wrote down, never something that fell out of an increment.
