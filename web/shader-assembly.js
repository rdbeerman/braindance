// The programs this page compiles, assembled out of a core spine each and whatever effect
// packages are installed.
//
// **Every spine is assembled in one call, and that is a refusal rather than a convenience.**
// There are two of them now - the point cloud's pair in `web/cloud-shader.js` and the grade
// pass's in `web/grade-shader.js` - and a chunk names the joint it joins, never the program
// it belongs to. So the joints of every spine are collected together before a package is
// read, one name means one place across all of them, and a chunk naming a joint nothing
// holds is refused by name. Assembling one spine at a time would have made that refusal
// impossible: the grade's assembly would meet the glyph field's `v.decl` chunk, and the only
// two answers available would be to throw on a chunk that is perfectly well placed
// elsewhere, or to skip it - which is the same silent absence as a typo, wearing the clothes
// of a design. The alternative considered and rejected was tagging every chunk with its
// program's name, which reintroduces exactly that: a tag nobody spelled right lands the
// chunk in no program at all, the page boots, and the effect is simply gone.
//
// **Assembly is concatenation and nothing else.** A chunk's text is spliced between two
// verbatim segments exactly as it arrived - not re-indented, not substituted into, not
// wrapped - because the property this whole split rested on is that the shipped set
// assembles to the four literals the two files used to hold, byte for byte, and every
// transformation on the way is a byte that can move. While the split was landing,
// `test/shader-assembly.test.mjs` held that equality against the last revision carrying
// each monolith; that arm is retired with the extraction it was scaffolding for, and the
// standing evidence is the ten-look probe recorded in `docs/performance.md`. What is left
// here to be right about is placement, and the test still refuses a flipped byte in any
// chunk that fails to move exactly the program its name promises.
//
// **Nothing is imported here and nothing may be.** The spine is data handed in and the
// packages are data handed in, so this module is a pure function of its two arguments -
// which is what lets the gate assemble the shipped tree under bare node, with no page and
// no server standing around it, and perturb one rule at a time. The same argument
// `web/effect-manifests.js` makes about the registry's conversion: one statement of it,
// used by the live page and by the test, because a test with its own copy of the
// assembler would be a second assembler agreeing with itself.
//
// The four kinds of joint a spine can hold, and each is a different question:
//
//   - a **stage** takes any number of chunks, concatenated in the order they declare.
//     Declaration blocks and helper tables are stages: two packages both adding uniforms
//     is the ordinary case, not a conflict.
//   - a **slot** takes at most one chunk and carries the text to use when nothing claims
//     it. A slot is a *replacement* - the glyph field's point-size branch stands where
//     the old clamp line stood - so two claimants is a refusal rather than a
//     concatenation nobody could read.
//   - a **service** is a value the spine computes under a gate generated from whoever
//     needs it: the condition is the `when` of every package consuming it, joined with
//     `||` in `gateOrder`, and the spine's own `open`, `body` and `close` are the text
//     around it. With no consumers the whole thing disappears, which is the point - a
//     build with neither glyph nor rain installed must not pay a mat3 multiply and two
//     hashes per point for a cell nothing reads.
//
//     **A service that closes something it opened is a scope, and that changes what its
//     consumers owe it.** `cell` opens a block, so `room` and `wc` are locals of that
//     block and a consumer's chunk has to go *inside* it - which is why a chunk naming a
//     service as its stage takes its place from `gateOrder` rather than from an `order`
//     of its own: the term in the gate and the block it opens are one placement. `region`
//     closes nothing: it computes `rw` at the surrounding scope, its consumers read that
//     value from wherever they happen to sit, and their chunks are placed by the stage or
//     slot they name. So the two services ask their consumers for different things, and
//     the refusals below are written per shape rather than as one rule that would have to
//     be wrong about one of them.
//   - a **varying declaration** is generated from the packages' `varyings` entries, in
//     three places out of one declaration: the vertex `out`, the fragment `in`, and the
//     line in the prologue that gives it its inert value above the early returns. One
//     statement rather than three, because an `out` with no `in` is a link error and an
//     `in` with no prologue write is undefined-register roulette on every shed point -
//     and a package declaring the three separately could get any pair of them out of
//     step.
//
// Every refusal below names the silent failure it is standing in front of. A chunk
// naming a joint that is not there would otherwise assemble into nothing at all: the
// page boots, the shader compiles, and the effect is simply absent with no error
// anywhere - which is the exact shape this repo keeps case files about.
