/**
 * A forwarding proxy that destroys the socket on the first heartbeat and answers
 * nothing, which is the one failure the worker's beat used to turn into permanent
 * silence.
 *
 * **`ECONNRESET` at the worker's `fetch` is what this is for, and nothing cheaper
 * produces it.** A 500 from the server resolves with a status rather than throwing, and
 * a 409 is handled inside the beat, so a transport-level failure is the only thing that
 * reaches the rejection path - and reaching it is the whole claim. Dropping the socket
 * without a response is exactly a reused keep-alive connection the far end had already
 * closed, or a moment of `EHOSTUNREACH` on a worker pointed at a remote `--url`.
 *
 * **It carries the whole render rather than the queue calls, because the worker has one
 * `--url`.** It resolves the take over it, loads `/edit` over it, and the page opens the
 * export WebSocket back to that same origin - so `upgrade` is handled by dialling the
 * server and piping the raw sockets both ways, and every RGBA frame of the export
 * travels through here. Splitting the origin into a second flag would have been easier
 * and would have made this fixture test a topology the program does not have.
 *
 * The headers go across verbatim, `Host` included, which is not incidental: the page's
 * `Origin` names this proxy and `originAllowed` compares the two, so rewriting `Host`
 * to the server's would turn every mutating request the page makes into a 403.
