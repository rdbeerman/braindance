// Proves that one registry drives the renderer, and that the panel is a view on it.
//
// Four claims, and they fail for different reasons, so they are checked apart.
//
// A parameter has to *land*. Setting it through the registry must reach the place
// the renderer actually reads - a uniform, a pass property, a pass `enabled` flag,
// the draw range, the drawing buffer - and several parameters do more than set a
// uniform, so the side effects are checked as side effects rather than assumed to
// come along. The landing sites are written out here rather than asked of the
// page, because a registry reporting its own values back would agree with itself
// whatever it did with them.
//
// The panel has to be a *view*. Both directions: a slider event has to move the
// registry, and a registry write has to move the slider and its readout. And the
// HTML has to carry no parameter data at all - no value, min, max, step or checked
// on a registry-owned input - or the range lives in two places again and step 6's
// headless renderer reads the copy that is wrong.
//
// The values have to *round-trip through an image*. Serialise the registry, render
// a pinned run and hash it, restore from the serialised set, render again: the
// same pixels. That is the property steps 5, 6 and 7 all rest on, so it gets a
// falsification control - every parameter is left out of the restore in turn, and
// omitting one has to change the image. Without that, the equality above would
// pass just as well against a registry wired to nothing.
//
// And nothing may have *moved*. The two built-in mode presets and the boot state
// are compared against the committed page rather than against a table typed in
// here, by serving `git show <rev>:web/{index.html,main.js}` into a second load.
// A table would only restate what the new code does.

// by construction when the instrument is pointed slightly wrong. A check nobody has
// broken on purpose is a check nobody knows the sensitivity of.
//
// Each entry names the row it must redden, and they are chosen to redden *different*
// rows: a mutation that fails everything cannot say which claim is load-bearing, which
// is the same reason `expand-shifts-by-a-block` exists beside `bind-ignores-grid` in

  // exactly 1.0 to the accumulator rather than nothing at all. A build that forgot
  // renders RGB completely transparent while every other reading stays correct.
  //
  // **This replaced a mutation that was caught for the wrong reason**, which is worth
  // recording because it is the failure this repo keeps producing in the direction that
  // looks like coverage. `blend-drops-alpha` removed the `* norm` from the alpha line
  // and claimed the three alpha-writing rows of 1b; measured, it left the whole of 1b
  // passing and reddened 8b instead - because at a single reading `norm` is 1.0 and
  // dropping a multiplication by 1.0 is not a mutation at all. It was a second, weaker

  //
  // **`duotoneSpan` is excused on the strongest version of these terms and is the only one
  // of the five that can say so.** The rest are excused because the pinned revision has no
  // such control; this one is excused because its default *is* the arithmetic that
  // revision ran. The ramp used to span the clip range, and the default here is the clip
  // range's own default width, so the division that converts it lands on exactly 1.0 and
  // the expression is the one the pinned build compiled. That is a claim about two float
  // literals rounding to the same value rather than about the derivation, so it is not

  // the frame's y, the pitch's own 1.3, and a hardness whose zero is the identity. So a
  // build carrying them draws precisely what a build without them drew, which is the
  // equality this arm measures. That it holds is not taken on trust: section 1b renders

// ================================ 1b. each reading renders what its mode rendered

// The claim the whole look/shading merge rests on, and the only one in this file that
// compares two revisions by their pixels rather than by their state.
//
// Dissolving `mode` into five weights rewrote the arithmetic every fragment goes
// through: what was one branch of a five-way `if` is now a weighted sum divided by
// the sum of the weights. The intent is that a single reading at 1.0 is arithmetically
// the identity - `x * 1.0 / 1.0` - so every look ever authored, every saved project and
// every preset renders the pixels it always did. That is an argument, and an argument
// about floating point in a shader compiled by a driver is worth exactly nothing until
// it is hashed.
//
// **Why this is not section 1 with another field bolted on.** Section 1 compares
// uniforms, slider values and readouts. It cannot answer this: the mode and the five
// weights exist on opposite sides of the comparison, so there is no field the two arms
// could both fill in. And its before-arm is deliberately a *pre-registry* revision -
// `--before` refuses any rev containing `const PARAMS` - which is a page with no
// `k.drive` and therefore no way to read a pixel at all.
//
// So this arm takes its own revision. `--against` wants the commit before the readings
// landed, which is a rev that has both the registry and the drive harness: exactly the
// rev `--before` will not accept. Two flags because they are two different questions.
// Before the readings are committed there is no commit introducing them, so the
// marker resolves to nothing and HEAD is the correct answer - that is the whole of
// the working-tree case, where the change under test is exactly what is uncommitted.
// Falling back is only safe because of the refusal below: if this ever silently
// resolved to a rev that already has the readings, the arm would compare the tree
// against itself and print five matching hashes as a pass.

  // branch being added and not one line of the arithmetic inside it. Every mutation in
  // this file's table is likewise blind to it, because the drop-one sweep compares arms
  // of one build against each other rather than against a build from before.
  //
  // What makes that a hole rather than a nicety is `presets-builtin/blackwall.json`,
  // which names `scanlines: 0.35`. The generalisation replaced an inline expression with
  // a coordinate through a local, which is exactly the substitution `docs/measurement.md`
  // records producing a third image out of two that were each bit-identical - so "the
  // defaults reach the old expression" is a claim about a compiler, and the shipped look
  // is what pays if it is wrong. `determinism-check` and `export-check` both read that
  // file and deliberately *follow* it rather than pinning it, so neither would notice.
  //
  // One reading, so the raster is the only thing that can differ between the arms, and
  // **Blackwall rather than colour, which is a correction rather than a preference.**
  // Written on `readRgb` first, this arm was an arm lit by a single source: the pinned
  // build selects a reading by integer mode and cannot mix, so one reading is all either
  // side gets, and `--mutate rgb-contributes-no-alpha` then renders black on both of them.
  // They compare identical, the control reports `0 of 6 frames differ with the master
  // off`, and the whole section fires against a mutation with nothing to do with the
  // raster - which is the last entry in `docs/instruments.md`, reproduced in the tool that
  // entry is about. Blackwall writes its own alpha and the readRgb block is guarded on a
  // weight this arm leaves at zero, so no reading's mutation can switch this probe off.
  //
  // It is also the more faithful choice: `blackwall.json` is the document that names a
  // scanlines of 0.35, so this arm now stands where the shipped look actually stands.
  //
  // **The two arms are handed different values on purpose, and the first version of this
  // row was wrong for exactly the reason that sounds like a bug.** Raising the raster
  // opens the grade pass on both builds, and the pinned one bakes its corner falloff into
  // that pass as `mix(1.0, vig, 0.55)` where this one reads a `vignette` parameter that
  // defaults to 0. So the obvious arrangement - the same look on both sides - compares a
  // frame with a vignette against a frame without one, and reports 6 of 6 frames differing
  // over a promotion that landed in `40ab241` and has nothing to do with the raster. Named
  // here, the two arms draw the same corner falloff and the raster is what is left.
  //
  // This is the units error `export-check`'s cross-build arm already records, arriving
  // from the other direction: **each build has to be given the values that mean the same
  // picture in its own vocabulary**, not the same numbers. `blackwall.json` names 0.55 for

// the slider says. Where the light goes is the entire claim the term makes, and nothing
// above this line tests it.
//
// **This is a probe placed where its answer is different rather than where it was
// convenient.** It exists because the direction was got wrong once already, from a
// derivation about which way v grows in the grade pass, and that build had every uniform
// landing, every image changing and a green suite. What caught it was somebody looking at a
// picture, and this is the arm that means the next one does not have to.
//
// **The arm calibrates its own axes rather than asserting them, and that is a repair rather
// than a design.** It was first written comparing row indices against a stated convention -
// `readPixels` reads from the lower-left, so light that falls lands at lower indices - and
// it went red on a build whose rendered frames plainly show the light falling. Rather than
// flip the comparison until it agreed, which is changing the code under test to satisfy the
// probe, both axes are measured here. The crop's four lateral faces cut in world metres,
// and the pinned camera looks along -z with world up on screen and world +x off to its
// right, so cutting the top removes light that is high on screen by construction and
// cutting the right face removes light that is over on one side of it. Which index each cut
// takes its light from is which way the rows and the columns run, read off this framebuffer
// on this build rather than remembered.
//
// **Each row is a difference between two opposite angles rather than a displacement from
// the picture, and that is a measurement rather than a preference.** The displacement form
// is what this section shipped with, and it carries a bias the size of the answer. The
// light a streak adds is only ever near the bright things, so its centroid sits where the
// highlights are as much as where the streak took them - measured on this fixture, the
// light added at 0 and the light added at 180 both sit about fifty columns to the *right*
// of the source's own centroid, so a row written that way would report a streak running
// rightward at both of the two angles that have no sideways component at all. The bias is
// common to both arms of a pair and cancels term by term, which is the same subtraction
// `level-check` makes when it reads its inset once with an empty depth grid.

// that describe the pair rather than its pixels, so `mixT`, `sinceFrameSec` and `spanSec`
// are written here by hand, and a section that forgot would be dividing a planted
// difference by whatever gap the last real frame arrived with.

// binds real frames over the plant and hands the shader a span to match. Everything below
// renders straight through `renderer.render`, which is what `renderProgramFrame` does
// itself at these parameter values, since none of the post passes are on.

// range, lands the parameter in its uniform, moves the picture when it is reverted, and
// satisfies the drop-one sweep completely. What it gets wrong is only visible from two
// ranges at once, which is what this section is: the whole point of the parameter is that
// the grade stopped following the framing, and a probe that never moves a crop face is a
// probe placed where its answer cannot be different.
//
// **The crossing plane is held at 1.5m in both arms while the range changes underneath
// it**, which is what makes the comparison about the width alone. `duotoneSplit` is a
// fraction of the range by design, so the two arms name different splits to describe the
// same plane - 0.5 through 0.5..2.5m and 0.25 through 0.5..4.5m. Every number here is
// exact in float32, on the planted section's reasoning: a row asking for equality cannot
// afford two quotients landing an ulp apart.
//
// The walls sit at 1.25m and 1.75m, a quarter of the way out from the plane on each side
// of a 1m ramp. Not on the plane itself, which is where the two builds agree by
// construction - k is 0.5 there whatever the width - and not outside the ramp either,
// where the shipped build saturates and the difference would be a clamp rather than a
// reading.
