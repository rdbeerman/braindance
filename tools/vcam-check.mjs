// The output to OBS: the webcam serves the colour camera, and the take never learns
// about it.
//
// Two outputs share one sink here - a program-out page OBS opens as a browser source,
// and an MJPEG endpoint OBS opens as a media source - and they have different failure
// modes, so this file has different arms for them.
//
// **The claim that needed a control is the webcam's.** The wire already carries
// colour: type 2's registered 512x424 JPEG, which is `Registration::apply`'s resample
// of the colour camera into the *depth* camera's viewpoint. An implementation that
// upscaled that to 1080p and served it would look almost right - same scene, same
// moment, plausible resolution - and would be wrong in the way that matters, because
// the registered image wears the depth camera's 70.6 degree frustum and is punched
// through with holes wherever the depth solve failed. Nobody would notice from a
// thumbnail.
//
// So the discriminator is geometric rather than perceptual. The colour camera sees
// 84.1 degrees where the registered frustum sees 70.6, which means a real colour
// frame carries scene content down the sides that no upscale of the registered image
// can invent. `fake-grabber --hd` plants exactly that: the HD fixture *is* the
// registered frame upscaled, plus a magenta left margin and a cyan right one. An
// implementation that cheats therefore matches most of the picture and still cannot
// produce the margin, and `--mutate hd-upscales-registered` is the arm that has to
// fail on it. **Dimensions are the convenient probe and the wrong one**: an upscale
// is 1920x1080 too.
//
// The six claims:
//
//  1. **It is asked for, not always on.** No type 3 crosses the pipe until something
//     subscribes, because a 1080p JPEG is another ~50Mbit/s down a pipe whose
//     backpressure reaches the grabber and costs the take. And it stops again.
//  2. **What is served is the colour camera, byte for byte.** The margin says it is
//     not the registered image; a hash against the writer's own emit log says nothing
//     re-encoded it on the way through.
//  3. **The take is untouched, and that is an identity rather than an assurance.**
//     With a webcam attached throughout, the closed take carries types 1 and 2 and
//     nothing else, and every frame in it is byte for byte a frame the writer logged.
//     Checked against the *writer's* record rather than against anything a reader
//     produced, for the reason step 7 established.
//  4. **The origin rule reaches every route that serves live sensor bytes**, asked of
//     the route table rather than of the one route this step added - so the next one
//     is covered by declaring itself.
//  5. **The program-out page renders at its own size with no furniture.** Section 5
//     drives a browser, because every other arm in this file watches the server and
//     `monitor-check`'s case file is that four sections which all did that missed a
//     renderer drawing the wrong thing entirely.
//  6. **A subscriber whose frames leave the machine is charged to the take**, and one
//     on loopback is not. Section 6 is the only arm in this repo that creates the
//     first kind, which is why the rule deciding it had never been tested by anything:
//     every other check subscribes over `127.0.0.1`, so the filter ran on an empty set
//     and deleting it would have changed nothing anybody could see.

// It spawns its own server and needs none running. The stream is

 * 3.8 to 4.7 seconds on a loaded machine and never under a second on an idle one. The
 * constant this replaced was 400ms, so sections 2, 3 and 4 were all asking their
 * questions of a server that had no sensor yet: the endpoint answered 503, no take
 * gathered a frame, and every row read as a finding about the webcam.
 *
 * `webcam.available` is the right predicate because of what `server/webcam.js` spends
 * a paragraph on: `unavailable` asks whether there is a colour camera to serve and
 * never whether a frame has arrived, so a hello with colour on clears it once and it
 * stays clear. It is also readable without subscribing, which section 1 needs, since
 * its first row is about what happens while nothing is subscribed.
 *
 * That row is the other thing this closes. It used to pass whenever the emit log was
 * empty, which is just as true of a grabber that had not started as of one that was
 * running with colour off - the right answer and the wrong one setting the same flag.
 * Behind this gate the grabber is provably up, so "no colour message" is provably a
 * decision rather than an absence.
 *
 * A timeout throws, which lands in the catch below and exits 2 as DID NOT RUN. Under
 * `--mutate` that distinction is the whole point: a harness that never got a sensor
