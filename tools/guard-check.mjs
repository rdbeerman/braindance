// Proves the two things the security commit claims: that a socket is held to the
// same origin rule the mutating routes stand behind, and that nothing is on the
// network unless somebody typed a flag saying so.
//
// Both claims are about what the server *refuses*, and a refusal is the one kind of
// behaviour that looks identical to a feature that was never reached. So every row
// here has a positive twin: the cross-origin upgrade must be refused **and** the
// same-origin one must open, the LAN address must be unreachable by default **and**
// reachable under `--host`. A check that only asserted the refusals would pass just
// as happily against a server that refused every upgrade, or bound to nothing at all.
//
// The bind half cannot be faked with a loopback alias. It asks the real network
// interface this machine has, because "not listening on 0.0.0.0" is only a
// meaningful claim if there is a second address a client could have arrived on -
// which is why a machine with no non-internal IPv4 makes this UNPROVEN rather than
// a pass. Same reading as `library-check`'s low-space row: "not tested here" and
// "tested and fine" are different answers.
