// Version 3 and version 4 documents, rewritten as version 5 documents on disk.
//
// **Two migrations, chained rather than combined.** A version 3 document takes both
// steps and a version 4 document takes only the second, which is why the band this
// accepts is written as the versions themselves in `versionRefusal` rather than as
// `PROJECT_VERSION - 1`: that spelling was true while there was one step and quietly
// stopped being when there were two. A combined 3-to-5 rewrite is the third path that
// would have to stay in step with the two it replaces, which is the duplication this
// file's own argument below refuses.
//
// Version 5 makes an ease handle a list of control points - `[0.42, 0]` becomes
// `[[0.42, 0]]`, the identical cubic with its degree written down - so that a segment
// can also be a quintic, which is the one curve family whose acceleration reaches zero
// at a key rather than only its rate. The step changes no rendered frame. It cannot be
// a sniff inside the loader for a reason stronger than the house rule: `[0.42, 0]` is a
// two-element array and so is `[[0.2, 0], [0.4, 0]]`, so a build that guessed would read
// a quintic's first control point as an entire cubic.
//
// Version 4 dissolved the shading mode into five reading weights. A version 3 preset
// carries `mode: N` beside its values and a version 3 project carries `look.mode`;
// this build carries neither, and refuses both rather than opening them - loudly, at
// the point the file arrives, which is the house convention and the right one. A
// version 3 file read by a version 4 build would otherwise parse perfectly: every
// value it names is still a parameter, `params.apply` would write all of them without
// complaint, and only the reading would be missing - leaving whatever the previous
// document happened to select. A look rendering as somebody else's shading, silently,
// is worse than one that will not open.
//
// So the conversion is a one-shot over files rather than a branch inside the loader.
// **That is not squeamishness about a compatibility path, it is the design rule this
// repo keeps restating**: one implementation, no second reader that can drift from the
// first. The mapping is total and lossless - mode N becomes `read<Name>: 1` with the
// other four at 0 - so there is nothing a runtime reader could do that this cannot do
// once, in advance, where the result is inspectable.

 * pulled `ghostRim` to 0.2 renders with 0.2 and is not the look it was saved as. The

 * this tool writes are the other half of that, and were missed.
 *
