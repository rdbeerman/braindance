// The full sweep, with the mutation list taken from each tool rather than written
// down beside it.
//
// The list used to be four arrays in a shell script, and the step 7 fix round grew
// library-check from 18 mutations to 37 - so that script would have run 59 of 78 and
// printed "all caught", which is the shape of failure this repo keeps naming: a check
// whose coverage claim is an assertion rather than something it enforces. Each tool
// already refuses an unknown mutation with `have a, b, c`, so that refusal is the
// enumeration and nothing has to agree with anything.
//
// Judged by failed-assertion count and never by exit code. A refused anchor, a
// Playwright context destruction and a real catch all exit non-zero, so fails=0 is a
// crash to investigate rather than a success to record - retried on the crash
// signature alone and reported UNPROVEN otherwise.

// merge waits on, not something to reach for while iterating.
